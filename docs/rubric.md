# VCSCI Evaluation Rubric

This rubric provides operational definitions and anchoring examples for each evaluation dimension.

## Purpose

The rubric ensures:
- Consistency across evaluators
- Reduced subjective variation
- Clear operational definitions
- Citable standards for research

## Rating Scale

All dimensions use a 5-point scale:

| Score | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **5** | Excellent | Exceeds expectations, exemplary quality |
| **4** | Good | Above average, minor improvements possible |
| **3** | Acceptable | Meets minimum standards for AAC use |
| **2** | Below Average | Significant issues, major improvements needed |
| **1** | Poor | Fails to meet basic requirements |

- Technical quality (proper SVG rendering)

### Rating Anchors

#### Score 5 (Excellent)
- Crisp, clean lines with no artifacts
- High contrast, immediately distinguishable elements
- Minimal visual noise
- Scales perfectly to any size
- Professional technical execution

**Example**: A bold, simple icon with 2-3 clear elements, high contrast black/white, perfect SVG rendering.

#### Score 3 (Acceptable)
- Generally clear but may have minor issues
- Adequate contrast in most contexts
- Some non-essential details present
- Readable at typical AAC device sizes
- Minor technical imperfections

**Example**: A recognizable pictogram with slightly thin lines or moderate detail level, still functional.

#### Score 1 (Poor)
- Blurry, pixelated, or low-quality rendering
- Poor contrast, hard to distinguish elements
- Cluttered with excessive detail
- Illegible when scaled
- Major technical problems

**Example**: A complex, detailed drawing with thin lines, low contrast, or rendering errors.

## Dimension 2: Recognizability

**Definition**: The ease with which a viewer can identify what the pictogram represents without additional context or explanation.

### Operational Criteria

- Immediate recognition (< 2 seconds)
- Matches mental model of concept
- Uses conventional visual representations
- Minimal ambiguity or alternative interpretations
- Works without text labels

### Rating Anchors

#### Score 5 (Excellent)
- Instantly recognizable by anyone
- Unambiguous single interpretation
- Uses universal visual conventions
- No caption needed
- Matches existing AAC standards (e.g., ARASAAC, PCS)

**Example**: A toilet for "bathroom", a bed for "sleep", a plate with food for "eat".

#### Score 3 (Acceptable)
- Recognizable with brief consideration
- Main meaning clear, minor alternative interpretations possible
- Uses common visual elements
- May benefit from context but not required
- Generally matches AAC conventions

**Example**: A pictogram showing a person + action that takes 2-3 seconds to interpret but is ultimately clear.

#### Score 1 (Poor)
- Difficult or impossible to recognize
- Highly ambiguous, multiple interpretations
- Uses obscure or personal symbolism
- Requires explanation to understand
- Contradicts AAC conventions

**Example**: Abstract shapes with no clear meaning, or representations that don't match the concept.

## Dimension 3: Semantic Transparency

**Definition**: The degree to which the pictogram accurately conveys the specific meaning of the target phrase.

### Operational Criteria

- Matches phrase meaning (not just a related concept)
- Captures key semantic elements
- Appropriate level of specificity/generality
- Conveys action, object, emotion, or relationship as needed
- Aligns with linguistic structure

### Rating Anchors

#### Score 5 (Excellent)
- Perfectly captures phrase meaning
- All key semantic elements present
- Correct level of specificity
- Appropriate to linguistic structure (verb vs. noun, etc.)
- No semantic loss or distortion

**Example**: For "I want to go to the toilet" → shows person + toilet + movement indicator, capturing want/need, location, and action.

#### Score 3 (Acceptable)
- Captures core meaning
- May miss some nuanced elements
- Generally appropriate specificity
- Main semantic components present
- Minor semantic drift acceptable

**Example**: For "I want to go to the toilet" → shows just a toilet, losing the "want/need" and "go" but still communicating the core need.

#### Score 1 (Poor)
- Misrepresents phrase meaning
- Missing critical semantic elements
- Wrong level of specificity
- Inappropriate to linguistic structure
- Significant semantic distortion

**Example**: For "I want to go to the toilet" → shows generic bathroom items without clear need/action indication.

## Dimension 4: Pragmatic Fit

**Definition**: The usefulness and appropriateness of the pictogram in real-world AAC communication contexts.

### Operational Criteria

- Practical for communication boards/devices
- Appropriate for target user age/ability
- Functional in typical use scenarios
- Socially appropriate
- Supports communicative goals

### Rating Anchors

#### Score 5 (Excellent)
- Highly practical for AAC use
- Age and ability appropriate
- Supports effective communication
- Socially appropriate in all contexts
- Facilitates user autonomy and dignity

**Example**: A pictogram that can be used confidently in public, at school, at home, etc., enabling clear communication.

#### Score 3 (Acceptable)
- Generally practical for AAC
- Appropriate for most contexts
- Functionally adequate
- No major social appropriateness issues
- Supports basic communication needs

**Example**: A pictogram that works well in most situations but might need supplementation in some contexts.

#### Score 1 (Poor)
- Impractical for real AAC use
- Inappropriate for target users
- Ineffective for communication
- Socially problematic
- Does not support user needs

**Example**: A pictogram that is embarrassing, unclear in context, or doesn't enable actual communication.

---

## Dimension 5: Cultural Adequacy

**Definition**: The appropriateness and relevance of the pictogram for the cultural and linguistic context of the target audience.

### Operational Criteria

- Culturally neutral or culturally appropriate imagery
- No offensive or insensitive representations
- Reflects target culture's norms and values
- Linguistically aligned (Spanish/English context)
- Avoids stereotypes

### Rating Anchors

#### Score 5 (Excellent)
- Perfectly culturally appropriate
- Reflects target culture authentically
- No stereotypes or insensitive elements
- Linguistically and culturally aligned
- Broadly acceptable across subcultural groups

**Example**: Food items, clothing, or activities that match the target culture's everyday life.

#### Score 3 (Acceptable)
- Generally culturally appropriate
- No major cultural violations
- May be culturally neutral rather than specific
- Acceptable across most cultural contexts
- Minor cultural adaptations possible

**Example**: Universal symbols that work across cultures, or items that are common enough to be recognizable.

#### Score 1 (Poor)
- Culturally inappropriate or offensive
- Reflects wrong cultural context
- Contains stereotypes
- Linguistically misaligned
- Requires significant cultural adaptation

**Example**: Food, clothing, or practices from a different culture, or stereotypical representations.

### N/A Option

Select N/A if:
- The concept is universally applicable
- Cultural considerations are not relevant
- Evaluator lacks cultural competence to judge

## Dimension 6: Cognitive Accessibility

**Definition**: The accessibility and usability of the pictogram for users with cognitive differences, learning disabilities, or intellectual disabilities.

### Operational Criteria

- Visual simplicity (not overwhelming)
